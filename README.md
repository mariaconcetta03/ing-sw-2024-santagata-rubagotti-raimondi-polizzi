### Jar
You can download the Jar to launch the game [here]().
## How to run
### Server
1. Open the prompt as **administrator**.
2. Set the registry of Windows to let it recognise colors using the following command:
```bash
reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```
3. Allow the prompt to show more characters in a single row: ```Prompt``` ```->``` ```(Right click) Properties``` ```->``` ```Layout``` ```->``` ```Deselect "Text output wraps when resizing"``` ```->``` ```Setting "9000" as width``` ```->``` ```Ok```
4. Launch jar file using the following command (**pay attention to your directory**): 
```bash
java -jar pathToServerLauncher\ServerLauncher.jar
```
5. Insert Server Ip address or press enter for localhost.
### Client
1. Open the prompt as **administrator**.
2. Set the registry of Windows to let it recognise colors using the following command:
```bash
reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```
3. Allow the prompt to show more characters in a single row: ```Prompt``` ```->``` ```(Right click) Properties``` ```->``` ```Layout``` ```->``` ```Deselect "Text output wraps when resizing"``` ```->``` ```Setting "9000" as width``` ```->``` ```Ok```
3. Launch jar file using the following command (**pay attention to your directory**):
```bash
java -jar pathToClientLauncher\ClientLauncher.jar
```
4. Insert Server Ip address or press enter for localhost.
5. Select the communication protocol and the UI preferred.
6. _(Only for RMI)_ Insert Client Ip address or press enter for localhost.
## How to play
1. When you launch the clientJar you will be able to choose your preferred network protocol (RMI/TCP) and user Interface (TUI/GUI).
2. You will then proceed with the nickname selection.
3. After that you will be asked if you want to create a new lobby or join an already existing one.
4. The game will start when the correct number of connected client is reached.
