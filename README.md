4. Launch jar file using the following command (**pay attention to your directory**): 
```bash
java -jar pathToServerLauncher\ServerLauncher.jar
```
5. Insert Server Ip address or press enter for localhost.
6. When finished playing, remember to reactivate your security settings:
```bash
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
```
### Client
1. Open the prompt as **administrator**.
2. Deactivate your antivirus and firewall services

## How to play
1. When you launch the clientJar you will be able to choose your preferred network protocol (RMI/TCP) and user Interface (TUI/GUI).
2. You will then proceed with the nickname selection.
3. After that you will be asked if you want to create a new lobby or join an already existing one.
4. The game will start when the correct number of connected clients is reached.
